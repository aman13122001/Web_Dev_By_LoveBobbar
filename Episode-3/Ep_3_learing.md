Qun. How the Internet Works?
Ans: 
1.You type a website name
Example: www.google.com in your browser (like Chrome).

2.Browser asks DNS Server
The DNS server finds the IP address (like 142.250.192.46) of that website.

3.Your device sends a request
It uses that IP address to contact the website's server.

4.Server responds
The server sends back the webpage data (HTML, CSS, images, etc.).

5.Browser displays the website
The browser reads the data and shows you the website on your screen.

Qun. Need of IP Address.
Ans: 
1.Identify devices on a network
(Like a home address helps identify your house)

2.Send and receive data
Without an IP, data won‚Äôt know where to go or where it came from

3.Enable communication
Devices use IP addresses to connect and talk to each other over the internet.

Simple Example:
When you visit a website, your IP tells the server ‚Äúwho is asking‚Äù, and the server's IP tells your device ‚Äúwhere to get data from.‚Äù

Qun.What is Client Server Model?
Ans: The Client-Server Model is a way computers communicate on a network.

Client = Sends requests
Server = Gives responses

Simple Example:
-> You open a website in your browser (Client)
-> The browser sends a request to the website‚Äôs server
-> The Server sends back the web page data
-> The Client displays it for you

Qun.What is ISP and it's need.
Ans:ISP stands for Internet Service Provider.
    It is a company that provides you access to the internet.

Need of ISP:-
-> Without an ISP, your device cannot connect to the internet.
-> ISPs give you a connection, an IP address, and help you browse websites, watch videos, send emails, etc.

Example of ISPs: Jio,Airtel,BSNL

Qun.Type of ISP.
Ans:
1.Dial-up ISP
Uses telephone lines
Very slow (rarely used now)

2.Broadband ISP

High-speed internet using DSL, cable, or fiber
Common at homes and offices

3.Wireless ISP (WISP)
Internet via wireless signals (Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G)
Used in rural areas or mobile networks

4.Satellite ISP
Internet via satellite signals
Used in remote or no-network areas

5.Fiber-optic ISP
Super-fast internet using fiber cables
Example: JioFiber, Airtel Xstream


Qun. What is packets?
Ans: Packets are small pieces of data that are sent over the internet.

When you send or receive something online (like a message, video, or website), it is broken into small parts called packets. These packets travel across the network and then get reassembled at the destination.

In simple words:
Packets = Small data blocks that carry information across the internet.

Example:
Sending a photo on WhatsApp = Photo is broken into packets ‚Üí Sent to your friend ‚Üí Reassembled into the full photo.

Qun.What is protocal Stack?
Ans:A Protocol Stack is a group (or stack) of rules that control how data is sent and received over a network.
Each layer in the stack has a specific job, and they work together to help computers communicate smoothly.
In simple words:
Protocol Stack = A set of communication rules arranged in layers

Example:
The most common protocol stack is the TCP/IP stack, used on the internet.

Qun.different layer of internet/ protocal Stack.
Ans:there are four Layers
1.Application Layer ‚Äì For apps like browsers, email
2.Transport Layer ‚Äì Handles data delivery (like TCP)
3Internet Layer ‚Äì Chooses path for data (like IP)
4.Network Access Layer ‚Äì Sends data through cables or Wi-Fi

Qun.how packet travel between Client and Server.
Ans:

1.Client Sends Request

You (the client) open a website like www.google.com.
Your browser creates a request, and it‚Äôs broken into small packets.

2.Packets Move Through Internet
These packets travel through routers, switches, and networks.
Each packet may take a different path to reach the server.

3.Server Receives Packets
The server collects all the packets.
It reassembles them to understand your request.

4.Server Sends Response
The server sends response packets (like web page data) back to you.
Again, the packets travel across the internet.

5.Client Receives & Rebuilds
Your browser receives the packets and rebuilds the webpage for you to see.

Qun.What is Switch, Hub, Router, Modem?
Ans:  
1.Switch
Connects devices in a network (like computers, printers).

Sends data only to the device it is meant for.
‚úÖ Smart device

üìå Use: In offices, schools, or homes to connect multiple devices.

2.Hub
Also connects devices in a network.

Sends data to all connected devices, not just one.
‚ùå Not smart ‚Äì slower than a switch.

üìå Use: Rarely used now, replaced by switches.

3.Router
Connects your local network to the internet.

Sends data between your devices and external networks.
‚úÖ Has Wi-Fi and assigns IP addresses to devices.

üìå Use: Used in homes to connect phones, laptops to the internet.

üì° 4. Modem
Connects your network to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).

Converts signals between digital (your device) and analog (internet line).

üìå Use: Needed for internet access via phone lines, fiber, or cable.

üîó How they work together:
Modem ‚ÜîÔ∏è Router ‚ÜîÔ∏è Switch ‚ÜîÔ∏è Devices (PC, phone)
üåê Internet comes through modem ‚Üí router shares it ‚Üí switch connects multiple devices.


Qun.What is OSI model and it's layers?
Ans: The OSI Model is a theoretical framework that explains how data moves from one computer to another through a network.

7 Layers of OSI Model:
1.Application ‚Äì User interacts (e.g., browser)
2.Presentation ‚Äì Data format, encryption
3.Session ‚Äì Start/stop communication
4.Transport ‚Äì Reliable data delivery (TCP/UDP)
5.Network ‚Äì Path selection, IP address
6.Data Link ‚Äì Device-to-device transfer
7.Physical ‚Äì Cables, signals, hardware

Qun.What is TCP/IP model.
Ans: The TCP/IP Model is a 4-layer framework that explains how data is sent and received over the internet.
It is the base model used for all internet communication.

4 Layers of TCP/IP Model:
1.Application Layer ‚Äì User-level apps (e.g., browsers)
2.Transport Layer ‚Äì Breaks data into packets (TCP/UDP)
3.Internet Layer ‚Äì Chooses the best path (IP)
4.Network Access Layer ‚Äì Sends data physically (Wi-Fi, cables)

Qun. What is Routing?
Ans:Routing is the process of finding the best path for data to travel from source to destination over a network.

Qun. What is Routing Table?
Ans:A Routing Table is like a map inside a router.
It stores paths (routes) to different networks, helping the router decide where to send the data next.

Qun. What is DNS Tree Structure?
Ans:The DNS Tree Structure is a hierarchical system that organizes domain names in a tree-like structure to help the Domain Name System (DNS) find the correct IP address for a website.

DNS Tree Structure Breakdown:
1.Root (.)
The top of the DNS hierarchy. It's represented by a dot (".").

2.Top-Level Domains (TLDs)
Directly below the root. Examples: .com, .org, .net, .edu

3.Second-Level Domains (SLDs)
Found just below the TLD. Examples: google in google.com, facebook in facebook.com.

4.Subdomains
Optional layers added before the second-level domain. Example: www in www.google.com.


Qun.What is a Protocol?
Ans:A protocol is a set of rules that governs how data is exchanged over a network.

Types of Protocols:
1.HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
Purpose: Used for transferring web pages over the internet.
Example: When you visit a website, the browser uses HTTP to request and receive data.

2.FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Purpose: Used for transferring files between computers over a network.
Example: Downloading files from a server or uploading files to a website.

3.SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
Purpose: Used for sending emails between servers.
Example: When you send an email, SMTP helps deliver it to the recipient‚Äôs server.

Qun.What is IPV4 And IPV6 and need.
Ans: 
IPv4:- IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol. It uses 32-bit addresses to identify devices on the internet, allowing for around 4.3 billion unique addresses.

IPv6:- IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the sixth version of the Internet Protocol. It uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses.

Need for IPv6:-
1.IPv4 has a limited number of IP addresses, which are running out due to the increase in internet-connected devices.

2.IPv6 was introduced to solve this problem, as it provides a vastly larger address space, ensuring that every device on the planet can have its unique address
